# NTU-STARS
A course registration IT system as a console-based application

## Functionality
1. Students can search and add courses to their schedules. They can drop the course or update to a different time slot/change the index of the course. 
2. The application will verify if the students stay with the maximum course load and if there are any clashes. 
3. Administrative staff can add and remove new students. They can also add, remove, and change courses, indexes, and their timings and venue. 
4. Using the inheritance OO concept, we made the lesson as the parent class while lectures, tutorials and seminar classes inherit the attributes and behaviour from the lesson parent class.
